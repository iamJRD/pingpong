#### By: Jared Beckler | Epicodus | January 2016

This project is further exploration of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery and is used to create a site to take in a user number input and count up to it, replacing every number divisible by 3 with "Ping", every number divisable by 5 with "Pong" and every number divisable by 15 with "Ping-Pong".
